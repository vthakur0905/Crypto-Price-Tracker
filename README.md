### The Power of React and Chakra UI 

D-crypto's seamless and stunning user interface is the result of leveraging the power of React and Chakra UI. React, the popular JavaScript library, ensures a dynamic and responsive application, making the user experience smooth and enjoyable.

Chakra UI, on the other hand, provides a delightful collection of customizable UI components that create an aesthetic and consistent design throughout the application. It not only enhances the visual appeal but also boosts development efficiency.

## Deployment

This project has been deployed on **vercel** and you can follow the steps to do the same as I did:

1. `npm i vercel` - This will install the Vercel Command Line Interface (CLI) tool as a dependency in your Node.js project. Vercel is a cloud platform that specializes in serverless deployment and hosting for web applications, serverless functions, and static sites.
2. `vercel login` - This command is used to authenticate yourself with the Vercel platform through the Vercel CLI. When you run vercel login, it initiates the authentication process and allows you to log in to your Vercel account directly from the command line.
3. `vercel` - This will start the deployment process and will ask you a few questions regarding your project, well you can keep default most of them and it will start the deployment process and provide you the link to your deployed application.
